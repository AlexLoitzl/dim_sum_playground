Definition LEM (P : Prop) := P ∨ ¬ P.

Lemma snoc_inv {A} (l : list A):
  l = [] ∨ ∃ x l', l = l' ++ [x].
Proof.
  destruct l as [|x l']. by left. right.
  elim: l' x => //. move => x. by eexists _, [].
  move => x ? IH x'. move: (IH x) => [x'' [l'' ->]].
  eexists x'', _. by apply: app_comm_cons.
Qed.
